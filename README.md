# Structural Based Drug Discovery
**Introduction**
Structural-based drug discovery has revolutionized the field of pharmaceutical research, offering a promising approach to understanding the intricacies [1] of disease and developing targeted treatments. This is becoming a fundamental part of industrial drug discovery projects and of academic researches. [2] SBDD is a more specific, efficient, and rapid process for lead discovery and optimization because it deals with the 3D structure of a target protein and knowledge about the disease at the molecular level. [3]


## An Overview Of SBDD Process
Many computer algorithms can be used to dock the huge databases of small molecules or fragments of compounds into the binding cavity of the target protein. [4] These molecules are ranked according to a scoring system based on electrostatic and steric interactions with the binding site.  The 3D structure provides detailed information about the intermolecular features that aid in the process of molecular recognition and binding of the ligand. [5]


### Advantage Of SBDD
The advantages of structural-based drug discovery are multifaceted. It streamlines the drug development process, reducing costs and timelines. Moreover, it increases the likelihood of success, as drugs are designed to interact with specific molecular targets. [6] This targeted approach also minimizes toxicity, a significant concern in cancer treatment.
- SBDD can help researchers design drugs with improved physicochemical properties, making them more effective and easier to administer. [7]
- SBDD can be used to design drugs that are tailored to individual patients' specific needs and genetic profiles.
- SBDD can provide valuable insights into protein function and biology, leading to a better understanding of disease mechanisms and the identification of new drug targets.
- Design of drugs with improved safety profiles: SBDD can help researchers design drugs with reduced toxicity and side effects, improving their safety profiles. [8]
- Ability to design drugs for emerging diseases: SBDD can be used to quickly design drugs for emerging diseases, such as pandemics or rare diseases.

#### Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning in Drug Discovery
- AI/ML can help identify promising compounds [9] and optimize their chemical structures for better efficacy and safety.
- Streamline clinical trials: AI/ML can help design more efficient clinical trials, identifying the most suitable patients and predicting treatment outcomes.
- Personalize medicine: AI/ML can help tailor treatments to individual patients based on their genetic profiles, medical histories, and lifestyle factors. [10]


**Conclusion**
Structural-based drug discovery has emerged as a powerful tool in the fight against cancer. By leveraging our understanding of biological structures, researchers can develop innovative, effective, and safer drugs. As we continue to push the boundaries of this approach, we may yet uncover new hope for cancer treatment and ultimately, a cure.
